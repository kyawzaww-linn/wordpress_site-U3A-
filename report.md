# Project Report: Neve Child Theme Development for U3A

## Overview
This project focused on the development and deployment of a customized WordPress Neve Child Theme for U3A. The project involved modifying the design, layout, and functionality of the child theme while ensuring a professional and seamless deployment process. The site was deployed on an AWS EC2 instance, with deployment automated using GitHub Actions and AWS Systems Manager (SSM).

## Technologies and Tools Used
This project made use of the following technologies and tools:

- **WordPress:** The core platform for the U3A website. The project required working extensively with WordPress themes, plugins, and content management.
- **Neve Theme:** The parent theme used as the base for the project. I developed a child theme to extend and customize the parent theme's functionality.
- **HTML, CSS, PHP:** These languages were used to create custom designs and templates in the child theme. PHP was especially crucial for integrating event calendars and membership forms.
- **Git and GitHub:** Version control was managed through Git, with all changes committed and pushed to a GitHub repository. GitHub Actions was used to automate the deployment process.
- **Docker:** Docker was utilized to create a local development environment that mimics the production server, ensuring consistent results during development and testing.
- **AWS EC2:** The website was hosted on an Amazon EC2 instance, which provided a robust and scalable environment for the site. I used AWS Systems Manager (SSM) to manage the deployment process.
- **GitHub Actions:** Automation of the deployment process was achieved using GitHub Actions. This allowed for seamless updates to the live site whenever new changes were pushed to the repository.

## Skills Developed

### 1. WordPress Development
- **Theme Customization:** Enhanced skills in creating and customizing WordPress child themes, including modifying the design (header, footer, and color schemes), adding new templates, and integrating custom forms and event calendars.
- **PHP and Template Hierarchy:** Gained practical experience working with WordPressâ€™s PHP-based template hierarchy, allowing for the creation of reusable components.

### 2. Version Control with Git
- **Proper Branching and Commits:** Followed industry best practices by creating structured commits with meaningful messages, ensuring future developers can understand the changes at every stage.
- **Collaboration via GitHub:** Used GitHub for version control, ensuring the project could be tracked, rolled back, or handed off seamlessly to other team members.

### 3. Local Development with Docker
- **Environment Replication:** Created a local development environment identical to the production server using Docker, enabling thorough testing before pushing changes live.
- **Containers and Virtualization:** Gained a deeper understanding of containerization through Docker, improving knowledge of isolated development environments.

### 4. Automated Deployment with GitHub Actions
- **CI/CD Pipeline Setup:** Set up a continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline using GitHub Actions. Every change pushed to the `main` branch automatically triggered a deployment to the production environment.
- **AWS SSM Integration:** Integrated AWS Systems Manager (SSM) into the deployment process, automating updates to the EC2 instance and reducing manual work and potential errors.

### 5. AWS Cloud Services
- **AWS EC2:** Deployed the WordPress site on an EC2 instance, managing everything from initial setup to monitoring and security updates.
- **AWS Systems Manager (SSM):** Managed and deployed updates to the server without requiring SSH access, improving security and efficiency.

### 6. Problem-Solving and Adaptability
- **Feedback Integration:** Continuously integrated feedback from my supervisor and improved the project, demonstrating the ability to adapt to changing requirements.
- **Attention to Detail:** Ensured that every aspect of the project, from documentation to code formatting, was handled with precision and professionalism.

## Employability Skills

This project demonstrates several key skills that will be valuable to any employer:

- **Technical Competence:** Expertise in WordPress development, PHP, HTML, and CSS, with experience in Docker and AWS.
- **Version Control and Collaboration:** Proficiency in Git and GitHub, with a focus on effective teamwork and collaboration.
- **Problem-Solving:** Managed all aspects of the project, from setting up local environments to solving deployment challenges.
- **Continuous Learning:** Actively integrated feedback and continuously improved the project. Eager to learn new technologies and best practices.
- **Communication and Documentation:** Provided high-quality documentation for development and deployment processes, ensuring smooth handoffs.

## Conclusion
The Neve Child Theme Development for U3A was a comprehensive project that allowed me to refine my skills in WordPress development, version control, cloud deployment, and continuous integration. By leveraging modern tools and technologies like Docker, GitHub Actions, and AWS EC2, I ensured a smooth and efficient workflow for both development and deployment. I am confident that the skills and experience gained from this project will make me a valuable asset to any team.
